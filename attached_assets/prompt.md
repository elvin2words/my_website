Attached is a thought-out **landing page concept sketch** that visually introduces the multifaceted identity of Elvin Mazwimairi. So the **black elements**, with the positioning and all that, provide the page’s **core structure** and **user flow**.

### Main Header - Transparent or semi translucent stretching from left to right at the top most view of the screen:

### **1. Contents:**

**"ELVIN MAZWIMAIRI"**

- Aligned to the left hand side of the header, this is clearly the header/title of the page. Its just the name of the individual since this is a **personal brand** or **portfolio site**.

“CodeCircle”, “DesignCircle”, “BizCircle”

- Aligned to the Right-hand side are 3 navigation links justified in the second half of the header bar.

### **2. Main Body:

"Who Am I???" - Intro styled Cloud Bubble Supposedto be aesthetic**

- Positioned somewhere appropriate just after the Elvin Mazwimairi title in header.
- Surrounded by question marks, this cloud seeks to introduces curiosity and introspection.
- Acts as a **main interactive hook** or **central theme**: self-identity explored through multiple facets.
- it has some kind of arrow poitnign to a section on the rigth hand side of the screen with the primary statement.

### **3. Primary Statement - Has to be aesthetically designed**

**"Well, frankly I am a number of things. Do learn more about me:" - Was thinking of changing it to: “Welcome to a snapshot of my world where Eng X Creativity X Innovation X Imagination. Thats the goal anywats, enjoy the ride. Do explore more about me:**

- This line serves as a **narrative transition**, inviting the user into an exploratory experience.
- Sets up the branching structure that follows where arrow branches stem from the primary statement as shown, pointing to other secondary sections, which will have to be clickable elements, with special effects when hovered and when clicked as it naviagtes to respective page.

### **4. Branching Navigation - Fluid arrows which are labeld “As A” and “As An” then they point to the various Identity Sections.:**

The five arrows lead to **five major identity paths**, suggesting clickable sections or animated transitions, and they ahev to be fluid and dynamically movign in adaptation to the movement of a certain identity section.

---

### **Main Identity Sections - These should be aesthetically placed around the screen, with the branched pointer connecting to each one. They should also allow click and hold drag around the screen, though upon release, they return to their original position. The following are the identity sections:**

### **A1: Electrical Engineer - Has an arrow branch with the tag “As An”**

- This defines my **technical and academic identity hence will have to connect and naviuagte to that page upon click.**
- The page linked would have formal achievements, project work, education, and engineering credentials and the likes.

### **A2: Systems Developer - Has an arrow branch with the tag “As A”**

- Represents user’s **software development and systems design** work.
- which Could include programming, modeling, simulation, automation, etc.

### **A3: Artistic Designer - Has an arrow branch with the tag “As An”**

- Explores the creative dimension—“Artistic” and “Layer Designer” refering to UI/UX, graphics, multimedia, or layered conceptual design work on a sepate page.
- Suggests a unique, expressive approach to creative design.

### **A4: Budding Technopreneur - Has an arrow branch with the tag “As A”**

- Entrepreneurial side page which highlights ventures, innovation projects, business models, leadership experiences, or startups.

### **A5: Human Being - Has an arrow branch with the tag “As A”**

- A more personal, reflective section.
- Implies depth beyond skills—philosophy, values, lifestyle, passions, and motivations.
- May include hobbies, inspirations, or causes you care about.

All these identity cards could have a minor description below them: **{Click to Explore}**

### After these, there then comes the footer bar. The design though explored in screnshot as a website landing page, it has to be fluid and responsive for a mobile and other hand held devices. We also have to workout the best aethetic visualisation for the different identity pages.
